# Samsung Technical Assignment

This is a technical assignment for Samsung. Based on [these instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GwcPe6PZwgDqxjMdfxQuAS1lmVIYTIbpDuZKA25TN8E/edit).


## Instructions
1. install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2. Run the project:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Tech
The frameworks that are used in this project are:
- React
- Typescript
- Vite
- Vitest
- EmotionJS
  - I used EmotionJS for styling. It is very similar to styled-components.
- MUI

## Notes
- As it was pride weekend in Amsterdam I added a custom rainbow header. (try hovering over it).

## Extensions
To keep the assignment within the timeframe I have not implemented all that I wanted. I just wanted to note some extensions:
- More tests
- Show individual model pages per product family
- Link to the samsung website for buying
- Add a search bar
- Add a filter for the products
- Make the images in webp format, this will reduce the load time
